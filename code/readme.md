The code is tested on MacOSX 10.10, Ubuntu 14.10, Windows 8 with Matlab 2014. We have contained the compiled mex files for all the platforms. If the code does not work on your machine, please run compile_all.m to compile all the mex c files.

example_fix_bits_ImageNet256.m is an example of how to use the code. 

We would like to thank
